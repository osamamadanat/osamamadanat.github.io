                                        The ancient city of Petra is one of Jordan’s national treasures and by far its best known tourist attraction. Petra is the legacy of
                                        the Nabataeans, an industrious Arab people who settled in southern Jordan more than 2,000 years ago. Admired then for its refined
                                        culture, massive architecture and ingenious complex of dams and water channels, Petra is a UNESCO World Heritages Site and one of
                                        the new Seven Wonders of the World. Inhabited by the Nabateans, Edomites and Romans, Petra brought together the knowledge and skill
                                        of these civilizations to create this world wonder. Caravans laden with incense, silks, spices and other exotic goods would rest
                                        at Petra.

                                        A spectacular natural wonder the Dead Sea is perfect for religious tourism and fun in the sun with the family. With its mix of beach living
                                        and religious history you can soak up the sun while Biblical scholars can get their daily dose of religious history. The leading attraction
                                        at the Dead Sea is the warm, soothing, super salty water itself – some ten times saltier than sea water, and rich in chloride salts of
                                        magnesium, sodium, potassium, bromine and several others. The unusually warm, incredibly buoyant and mineral-rich waters have attracted
                                        visitors since ancient times, including King Herod the Great and the beautiful Egyptian Queen, Cleopatra. All of whom have luxuriated
                                        in the Dead Sea's rich, black, stimulating mud and floated effortlessly on their backs while soaking up the water's healthy minerals 
                                        along with the gently diffused rays of the Jordanian sun.
